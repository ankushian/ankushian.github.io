Everything in this universe is an object, so it's not wrong to objectify something; it's simply looking at it from an abstract, or rather say, primitive level. We endow meaning upon objects, but objects themselves hold no implict meaning, unless interpreted in a certain way. The endowment is of meaning is layered. We first register an object; then a living being, then a human, then a woman. So, when we say **a woman is an object**, we refer to the basic layer of recognition. An object we humans manipulate arbitrarily, and therefore it's never wrong to pursue the same practice when dealing with a woman, which maintains a logical consistency.
