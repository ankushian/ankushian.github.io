title: JavaScript, an incurable cancer
---

Majority of websites today use unnecessary JavaScript. This website pays homage to Santacharya's philosophy of minimalism by not having a single line of JavaScript for the blog. All pages of the website are static, and proportion of the content is far higher (~8 KiB on average) than the HTML template (~2 KiB) as should be virtue of a blog. The stylesheet is held at minimum (~80 lines of CSS), and the focus is more on the meditations than style.

It's not hyperbolic when people say, web developers are attracted to whatever new framework is trendyâ€”it's truth. Using an unnecessary lot of frameworks is a form of consumerism; they make frameworks, you use them. It should be quite obvious that JavaScript is a grotesque language, and defenders of it are suffering Stockholm Syndrome. JavaScript had been conceived as a viral cancer as it developed in the body of Brendan Eich, then subsequently spread through the internet by Netscape Navigator. Since then, it only proliferated. Web developers have had tried to find a cure, but ultimately failed and lost hope. An indie film named *Frameworks: or, How I Stopped Worrying and love [JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck)* by fellow web-developers is in the making, but is suffering scheduling issues due to pressure of office work.
