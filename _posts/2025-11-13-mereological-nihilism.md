An object is a span of identifiable matter in enclosed by an arbitrary three-dimensional spatial boundary. As per abiogenesis, all life has had been the product of spontaneous synthesis of biomolecules into more complex cell-structures under the environment of the primordial earth. If atoms are objects (considering atom to be primitives), and molecules to be composites then it could as well be generalised that all lifeforms are objects. Drawing a simple deduction, it can be said that all humans are objects for they form a subset of lifeforms, and all lifeforms are objects. Women form a subset of the human population, so it can be concluded that “women are objects”, or more elaborately, “women are atoms arranged in a certain spatial pattern”; this generates a contradiction as the general ethical beliefs that “women are not objects”. The ethical beliefs have to fall out in favour, for if they're to be chosen to resolve this logical conflict, physical realities have to be disparaged. 

Thus in conclusion, it's only rational to choose the statement that could be deduced logically from stronger postulates rather than arbitrary ones.
