Dubbed as the **Indian Marquis de Sade** (father of sadism), Harisai Karthikeyan (born 2001) was renowned as a vicious paedophilic serial killer. His attacks were primarily perpetrated on vulnerable children, whom he subjected to his inhumane sexual fantasies as atrocious as BDSM, and even rape. CBI seized his property ialong with his DVDs full of child pornography.

Karthikeyan wasn't always like this however. He was born in a lavish bourgeoisie family; never had to ask for anything. Everything was served to him on a silver platter. Despite having been born with such huge wealth, life hadn't been so pleasing for Karthikeyan. His parents never let him mingle with people of lower status, forcing him to grow up in isolation, oblivious to the rules of the world. He was homeschooled by hired tutors, who tried their best to educate the then-nascent libertine, but ultimately failed.

## The Origins
One night, Karthikeyan peeked inside his mother's bedroom, discovering that she was vigorously masturbating while watching a pornographic video on their 48" LED TV of a young man having intercourse with an older woman (MILF) on all fours. Karthikeyan, who just hit puberty, was attracted by it. Beginning from then, he reatained his practice of peeking into his mother's room in hopes of witnessing his mother masturbate. He would even capture pictures of his mother's vagina on his luxurious touchscreen phone, then masturbate to that.

Fourteen by then, Karthikeyan, had come across an abandoned DVD of **A Serbian Film**. A day when his parents were out of town, he chose his life's biggest decision by playing the DVD. His nascent libertine mind was captivated by the scenes; it was a fantasy fuel for him. Inspired by that he desired to rape women, ravage their bodies if they were toys, revel in their pleas of mercy. Runaway from home at age fifteen, he was involved in a large sex scandal operated throughout Karnataka, after having met a mysterious man named Nick Nightingale at a gay bar. He then embarked on a frenzied rampage, attending orgies where riches held their depraved fests. Five years later, he eventually came in vicinity of a paedophilic noble woman, who purchased him for a large sum of money as her faithful sex slave, and became his sugar mother.

## Crime Spree
He operated various crimes in her aegis. Seventeen as of 2016, Karthikeyan watched the movie **Melancholie der Engel**. His mind completely berserk by then, had he one day rampaged to perpetrate attack on six college girls whom he met in a nightclub. He lured them in his trap, after silently adding sedatives in their beer. He first murdered them, then raped their corpse and also mutilated them in a grotesque way. He carried them all into his slaughterhouse, then disembowelled their corpse, extracting all organs that could be sold on the black market. He—a cannibal—ate the remaining of their bodies. He continued his crimes, but later mainly target children who were lost.

## Final Days
CBI Investigation began as of late 2017. After numerous failed attempts, Karthikeyan was successfully captured in 2018 from Jaipur, Rajasthan. At his trial, he was unanimously sentenced to lifelong imprisonment by the Supreme Court of India. The news spread like a wildfire throughout Indian media, spurring various debates and discussions. The entire nation put to trauma by the sheer brutality of the incident.

While imprisoned in Tihar Jail, he secretly wrote novels containing philosophical treatises on the nature of man. It contained disturbing and graphic depictions of rape and bestiality. His book was centred around a teenage boy named N.P.B, who had a sadistic rape fantasy of cats. Manuscripts of this novel were secretly smuggled from prison, and were brought to limelight with the pseudonym A. Saha, but it was tentatively banned by authorities because of its brutal content.

Karthikeyan had became an adult by 2019, thus Supreme Court of India this time sentenced him to death by hanging on the Christmas of 2019.
