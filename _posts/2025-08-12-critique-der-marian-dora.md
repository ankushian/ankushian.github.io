In the world of transgressive cinema, **Marian Dora** has surely cemented himself as one of the most hardcore exploitation film directors along with Ruggero Deodato (director of *Cannibal Holocaust*; 1980) and Srđan Spasojević (director of *A Serbian Film*; 2009). His *arthouse* films, he claims, deal with both the best and worst of human nature. Now, based on an extensive set of reviews about *The Angel's Melancholia* (2009), and sometimes some of his other films, that his films deal with the *best of human nature* is rather arguable. His films are set in a macabre atmosphere, and feature no less than nudity, masturbation, rape, sadism or grotesque kinks as atrocious as coprophilia or urophilia. Disembowelling animals and even humans is rather common in his films, and that too in full nauseating gory detail.

## Director Himself

Marian Dora is a pseudonym, based on the initials of his real name. He is known to be a resident of South Germany as per Magnus Blomdahl's documentary *Revisiting Melancholie der Engel* (2017). All the interviews featuring the director have his face censored or pitch of his voice altered. Some say he's a physician/surgeon, but he never verified it. If he is however, that would vaguely explain why he feels the need to display autopsy, colonoscopy or cannibalism in such great detail. Some criticise him as delusional for the way he speaks in interviews.

Dora is an acquaintance of Ulli Lommel (director of *Boogeyman*), and has worked with him as a second-unit director; before that, he made several short-films (of no value). Nonetheless, he's quite a hardworker as he deals with many aspects of his films, starting on from 

> It should be immediately clarified that Marian Dora has no relation to the [other Dora][other-dora], although both have a knack for exploration. Whereas Dora with her friend explores the world, Marian Dora explores the dark corners of the human mind, going so far as to dissect the human body to show what makes us a complete mammal.

## Films of the Underground

The audience of his films are polarised into two categories—followers and sceptics. Two of his most famous and controversial films are *Cannibal* (2006) and *The Angel's Melancholia* (2009). The latter of which brought him fame or perhaps infamy as a director.

His other films include—*Debris Documentary* (2003), *Trip to Agatis* (2010), *Carcinoma* (2014), *The Blight of Humanity* (2018) & *Yearning of Maria D.* (2018), *Thomas and Marco* (2022).

### Cannibal

*Cannibal* (2006) was based on the real case of **Armin Meiwes**, the Rohtenburg cannibal who in 2001, invited a man on the internet over to his house to eat. It was an assignment of Ulli Lommel to Marian Dora, but what he presented horrified Lommel (because of the gore), and instead he scrapped Dora's work made his own film *Diary of Cannibal* (2007), which unfortunately became one the worst films ever made.

> It's all done very abstract, using minimalist dialogue, buffering scenes with *every Bible quote Lommel could find about eating or sacrifice*, over directed with a masturbatory amount of fancy edits, fades, black & white footage, fake scratches to the digital image to make it look like an old 8mm reel, and montages out the wazoos. <br/><br/>

> — **The Dread Central** on *Diary of a Cannibal* (2007).

Another notorious feature of Cannibal is its portrayal of gay romance and sex between the Man (played by Carsten Frank) and the Flesh with horse neigh as SFX for orgasm—maybe amateurishness is just characteristic of *arthouse* cinema.

> One of the sickest and freakiest movies ever to come from a nation well-known for its freaky and sick movies (Germany), *Cannibal* is shocking, outrageous, sickening ... and just a little bit interesting because it's based on actual events. <br/><br/>
>
> — **Scott Weinberg** on *Cannibal* (2006).

Dora although made a graphically accurate version of the case, Meiwes however had recorded a four-hour long video of the actual incident, where he dismembered Bernd Brandes (a telecom engineer) and hung his body from a meat-hook. That video has never been made public by the authorities (for good reasons of course).

### Angel's Melancholia

*Angel's Melancholia* (2009) was Dora's first original feature. It features an ensemble cast of three male leads—Katje (Carsten Frank), Brauth and Heinrich and four female leads—Anja, Bianca, Melanie and Clarissa. They embark on a sadistic orgy in a haunted house, where all turn insane and hurl violence upon each other. 

The story of it is simply that, two friends—Katje and Brauth—long ago tortured a pregnant woman, and the house is haunted ever since. The friends reunite, then Katje confesses his paranoia for his soon-to-come death to Brauth. They enter a fair where they meet two young girls—Melanie and Bianca. At some bar the group meets Anja, and they drive away to the haunted house. Things start to escalate when they meet an artist named Heinrich, who claims himself to be *dead*, and also a woman named Clarissa who was tied to a wheelchair with a colostomy device. Things start to escalate from that point onward, and they swirl into an inescapable abyss of pure sadism. Many animals are cruelly murdered *for real*; a dead rabbit is beheaded, then disembowelled; a living cat's throat is slit; a pig is slaughtered. Some of the women are brutally raped and tortured, including stabbing a girl's vagina with a knife. The men inflict self-harm on themselves. A girl masturbates to a VHS tape, where a newborn being beheaded is seen. The group murders Heinrich, and burn him on a pyre, while simultaneously masturbating and ejaculating into the fire. Finally, Katje dies and Anja mourns his death. And, it is announced that he is an angel (in Ulli Lommel's voiceover).

It's no doubt his most discussed film, and one of the projects Dora was most passionate about; frequently it appears in the lists of "most disturbing movies ever made" across the internet, often billed as *beauty-within-madness* (by followers) or *a depraved, perverse and nihilistic endurance test* (by sceptics). 

The filming of it was not only mentally stressing but also physically. Dora himself lost more than 16kg during film production; slept for barely half-an-hour. He admitted that only ten-percent of what he had in mind was put into the film. His lead actor-cum-producer Carsten Frank had disagreements over inclusion of the some more extreme scenes, involving a mutilation of a *real dead body* in a morgue. It was illegal, but Dora told it was to serve as a central plot to the story. **This means he not only violated animal rights, but also human rights!** And when it is said, it's not hyperbolic; its the absolute truth. He admitted manipulating people on the set to shoot his film. He even recounts in *Revisiting Melancholie der Engel* (2017), that film was based on a true incident, where a group similarly went into an abandoned house and the members went missing thereafter.

Dora received a lot of death threats following the premiere of his film, and for obvious reasons. The only redeeming part about it is its musical score, particularly David Hess's song Lullaby.

### Hypocrisies & Delusions

> **Bodily fluids are a central theme in your world of cinema. Where does the fascination with excrement come from?** <br/><br/>
>
> Imagine the situation: You make a film without any time, without any money, and without any possibilities. Underground filmmaking simply. The only thing you can use is the body of the actor, of course. This is why I routinely show bodily functions. What you see is nothing special, it is everyday occurrences. Here I pay attention to keep the right measure. For example, I show in every film more often a person eating, than a person emptying the body. Oddly enough people speak me about the body emptying scenes, but not about the eating scenes. There is obviously an imbalance in the perception of some people. I can only speculate about the reason.

Either he's being sarcastic, or is completely delusional.

> **A lot of your viewers, even your devoted followers seem to detest your use of animal violence in some of your films, in particular Melancholie. Why do you feel the need to portray animals suffering, tortured and killed in your work? Do you feel it’s a strong metaphor for human suffering and easier to get across with such raw emotion from an actual dying life form?** <br/><br/>
>
> It is a part of the specific philosophy of my films to **avoid the faking of scenes like torturing animals or human beings**. But there are some reasons going beyond that philosophy. Usually there are three reasons to use scenes like that you mentioned in your question. The first reason is that such scenes help to clarify the characterisation of the protagonists. Personally, I don’t think this is a good justification for the use of reality. The second, more important reason is to create the appropriate atmosphere. The closer you come to reality, the more intense the pictures will be. The third reason is the most important reason — **scenes like that are a declaration that the film you are watching is not made for entertainment**. You can select the audience — everyone just watching a film to have fun will be rejected.

According to Marian Dora, if you want your audience to know your film is transgressive, you have to slaughter real animals! 

> **... In the mediabook liner notes [of Blight of Humanity (2018)] you describe that in the last 20-years how 50% of the rainforests are destroyed and 20% of animals have become extinct — a true blight to humanity. Do you feel this statement is somewhat hypocritical of you? In Blight of Humanity (2018) various animals and insects and killed on screen, as well as many piglets are dispatched and brutally mutilated with spears. Why did you feel it essential to kill so many animals for the sake of a movie? Surely the torment and rape of the female character in the film was impactful enough, rather than instigating to the death of innocent animals that you so delicately capture in nature scenery.** <br/><br/>
>
> Let me tell you, I never killed a human being or an animal for the purpose of a film. Never. I only FILMED people doing it. This is not uncommon for underground films. If you compare a shooting with the My Lai incident, then I am Medina, not Calley. It wouldn’t had been necessary for scientists to perform a Milgram experiment. They simply should have joined the shooting of an underground film. Every shooting is a Milgram experiment.

A director's job is ofcourse not directing the actors of the film, right? Who's he trying to fool?

> **In Melancholie Der Engel a young wheelchair bound girl is constantly mistreated and brutalized. What point were you trying to get across with this?**<br/><br/>
>
> The girl in the wheelchair was a victim and she was consequently treated as a victim. For the film it is not very important what happens to this girl. Only the feeling and thinking of the main protagonists is important. Sometimes it’s a little bit sad that people only look at such marginal — and very short in relation to the running time — scenes. *Angel's Melancholia* is about much more — about friendship and the destiny of the two leading males. If I only would have in mind to shock the people, I could do much better, believe me.

His words sound borderline misogynistic, because if the women don't serve an autonomic purpose in Angel's Melancholia, why feature them in an ensemble cast? To be defenceless objects for the men to vent their anger or perversion? Does he mean to say, men can brutally rape them at will, and they won't be affected afterwards neither physically nor emotionally?

> **Was the cutting of Anjas’s breast in Melancholie der Engel real?**
>
> Yes.

See? I wasn't being hyperbolic when I said he abused human rights. 

> **In your initial interview with Severed Cinema you stated that Debris Documenter is in some ways autobiographical. Do you resonate with the sexual depravity and copious amounts of bodily fluids presented forth by Carsten Frank? Could you elaborate?* <br/><br/>
>
> Indeed *Debris Documentary** shows the real person Carsten Frank. There is a lot of intersection between him and me, this is why it is justified to call the film autobiographical. In a way the film addresses the eternal question of underground filmmaking: how far would I go? Is it justified to bring the sacrifice of a human life for my film?...

So he resonates with masturbating to snuff films? That would be a very Marian Dora thing to do.

## Final Verdict

What directors of arthouse cinema like Marian Dora don't understand is art itself. Cinema isn't a gorefest to masturbate to (as does Carsten Frank in *Cannibal* or *Debris Documentary*). It is a medium of expression, an art form. Great cinema is coherent, nuanced, and expressive; using it to depict your fetishes is certainly *an exercise in poor taste* as put by John Waters. Violence is a plot device used to convey a poignant message through its metered and effective use. Relying merely on shock value is what pseudointellectual arthouse film directors like Marian Dora do. His film Melancholie der Engel is a comprehensive manual of how a filmmaker should never make a film.

Yes, great cinema can be grotesque, but it has to be meaningful. *Eraserhead* (1977) by David Lynch is a grotesque, not easily understood film, but it is meaningful in that it embodies the fear of fatherhood in its motifs. *A Clockwork Orange* (1971) by Stanley Kubrick is an *ultraviolent* film that was controversial for its time, but its meaningful in portraying a cynical view of how society deals with evil. Even *Salò* (1975) by Pier Paolo Passolini, an adaption of Marquis de Sade's novel *120 Days of Sodom*, could be considered a poignant transgressive film about the horrors of facism. 

*Melancholie der Engel* or any exploitation film in comparison, don't hold any substance to them. They exist for the mentally disturbed for their sick enjoyment. By quoting Nietzsche, Goethe, Sade, and others, not only Marian Dora does a pathetic attempt at saving his film, but proves his incompetence as a director by producing pornography in the name of art.
