Bloat is ubiquitious. Humans have loaded their knowledge with so much bloat, that the society is now on the brink of collapse. My point is—why? Our life should be as simple as a caveman, because as we know it—simplicity is the ultimate sophisitication! Our caveman lives could be augmented, for example with "clothes", but it should not be mandatory. A man or woman would be nude by default, just as are other mammals.

Language is bloat—why so many words? Most of our conversations could easily be conveyed by simple hand signs. Physics is bloat too—why not just let happen what is happening? Chemistry (no surprise) is also bloated—why not just let the reactions occur? Mathematics is bloated too—what is the need for calculus, when in real life, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division is all we ever need? Biology is bloat—why care about your health so much, when you're going to die anyway?

Embrace nihilism—no frivolity, no bloat.
